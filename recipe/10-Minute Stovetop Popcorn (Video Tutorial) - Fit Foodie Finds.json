        "Place 1/2 tablespoon of oil on the bottom of a medium to large pot. Make sure your pot is at least 2.5 quarts so that it can fit the popped kernels. Turn heat to medium/high and place two unpopped popcorn kernels in the oil. Cover and let sit, shaking periodically.",
        "Once the two popcorn kernels have popped, you can add the rest of the unpopped popcorn. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, cover, and shake kernels\u00a0so that they are fully coated in oil.",
        "Continue to periodically shake kernels (with the top on) about every 20 seconds so that the kernels don\u2019t burn. Soon enough, they will begin to pop!",
        "Continue shaking pot as the popcorn pops. Once there are about 2 or 3 seconds in between pops, you know the popcorn is done popping and it\u2019s time to eat!",
