        "3 tablespoons olive oil, divided",
        "2 medium heads broccoli, chopped into small pieces (~6 cups)",
        "1/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1/4 medium red onion, finely diced",
        "1 large red pepper, diced",
        "1/4 cup dried cranberries",
        "1/4 cup sunflower seeds",

        "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar",

    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium/high heat.",
        "When olive oil is fragrant, add the broccoli to the pan and season broccoli with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let the broccoli cook for about 3 minutes, stirring periodically.",
        "After 3 minutes of cooking, add the red onion to the pan and cook for an additional 2 minutes. You want the broccoli to start to brown a bit, but not get mushy!",
        "Remove the broccoli and onion from heat and transfer into a large bowl.",
        "Add the red pepper, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and feta cheese to the bowl and mix all of the ingredients together.",
        "Finally, drizzle on lemon juice, remaining olive oil, and balsamic vinegar over the salad and mix one final time.",
        "Add more salt and pepper to taste and enjoy immediately or place in the refrigerator for a meal prep salad."
