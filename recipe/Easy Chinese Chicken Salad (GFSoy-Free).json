    "instructions": [
        "Start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Then add chicken, slightly reduce heat to medium-high, cover, and cook until done all the way through \u2014 about 10 minutes. Then remove and use two forks to shred. Set aside.",
        "In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding coconut aminos, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maple syrup, fresh ginger, and garlic to a jar (or mixing bowl) and shaking vigorously (or whisking) to combine.",
        "Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more ginger for zing, garlic for kick, maple syrup for sweetness, sesame oil for more prominent toasted sesame flavor, or coconut aminos for more saltiness. Set aside.",
        "Shred your napa cabbage, red cabbage, and carrot, slice the green onions, and add to a large serving dish or bowl. Toss to combine.",
        "Next add sesame seeds and almonds to a small pan and toast over medium heat for ~5 minutes until just slightly golden brown, stirring frequently. Be careful not to burn. Set aside to cool.",
        "Add shredded chicken breast to salad, along with toasted sesame seeds and almonds. Top with dressing and toss to combine. Season with a bit of salt and pepper for more flavor. Sample salad and add more salt and/or pepper to taste or more coconut aminos for depth of flavor.",
        "Serve immediately or store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Not freezer friendly."
