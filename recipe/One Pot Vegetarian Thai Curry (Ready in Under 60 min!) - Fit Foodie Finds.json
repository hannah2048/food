        "Add in sliced bell pepper, snow peas, and garbanzo beans and saute for 2 more minutes. You don\u2019t want to cook everything down, just a quick saute.",
        "Then, add white rice, coconut milk, vegetable broth, red curry paste, and rice vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium/high heat. Once boiling. Cover and turn the heat down to low. Let simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked.",
        "Once the rice is fully cooked, squeeze in fresh lime juice. Then, give it a taste and adjust the salt, as needed. Option to add a little maple syrup if you prefer your curry on the sweeter side or some siracha/chili garlic sauce to make it spicier.",
