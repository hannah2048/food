    "instructions": [
        "Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt (1/3 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Add garlic, ginger, bell pepper, and green chili and stir. Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Next add chicken breast (or omit if not adding \u2014 you\u2019ll double up on chickpeas later), ground coriander, chili flake, turmeric, and paprika and stir to coat. Add another one-third of the salt (1/3 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Next add diced tomatoes (optional: pur\u00e9e one of the cans of tomatoes in a small blender before adding for a creamier sauce). Then add chickpeas, garam masala, coconut sugar, and remaining salt (1/3 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).",
        "Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.",
        "Add coconut milk and stir to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes on medium-low heat. Then taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt to taste, chili flake (or a pinch of cayenne) for heat, coconut sugar for sweetness, cumin or paprika for smokiness, or garam masala for a more spiced / earthy flavor.",
        "Garnish with fresh cilantro and jalape\u00f1os for added heat (optional). Can be enjoyed as a stew, or with white or brown rice or cauliflower rice. Another favorite is serving over roasted sweet potatoes.",
        "Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month."
