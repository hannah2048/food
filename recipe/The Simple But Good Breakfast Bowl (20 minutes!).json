        "6 stalks curly kale, chopped  ((large, stalky stems removed))",

        "1 pinch each sea salt + black pepper",

    "instructions": [
        "Heat a large skillet (we love this cast iron) over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and swirl to coat. Add sweet potatoes in an even layer (to ensure they cook evenly) and cover. Cook for 4 minutes or until underside is golden brown. Then flip and cover again. Cook for another 3 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender.",
        "In the meantime, heat a separate skillet (we love this cast iron) over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and swirl to coat. Then add mushrooms to one half of the pan and season with a dash of coconut aminos. Then add cabbage to the other half of the pan and season with curry powder and salt. Toss to coat and cover to cook until tender \u2014 about 5 minutes \u2014 stirring occasionally.",
        "Once golden brown and tender, push to one side of the pan and add kale. Season with a pinch more salt and cover. Saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally until wilted and bright green. Transfer to serving bowls but keep the heat on. Quickly crack eggs into the still-warm pan and season with a pinch each salt and pepper. Cook for about 1 minute over medium heat, then cover and cook another 2-3 minutes to cook the white but keep the yolk runny (our favorite method).",
        "Transfer cooked sweet potatoes to the serving bowls and top with runny egg. Garnish with hummus, sprouts, and fresh parsley (optional). Best when fresh. Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days (kale and eggs best when cooked to order). Not freezer friendly."
