        "Next, turn the on Instant Pot\u2019s saute feature and add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the bottom of the pot.",
        "When the olive oil is fragrant, add onion to the pot and saute for 1 minute. Then, add garlic, chopped mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook for an additional 2 minutes.",
        "Next, pour broth into the bottom of the pot and set the trivet on top of all of the vegetables.",

        "While the veggies are sauteeing, carefully scoop out the innards of the spaghetti squash. We like to use a fork to fluff the \u201csquash noodles\u201d and then scoop everything out. If you are serving this dish immediately, make sure to keep the squash skin intact so that you can serve it inside the squash half.",
