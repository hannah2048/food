        "Prepare brown rice using either the Instant Pot method or the Perfect Brown Rice method (which doesn\u2019t require an Instant Pot). Set aside. Prepare black beans using either the Instant Pot method or the Black Beans from scratch method (which doesn\u2019t require an Instant Pot). Set aside. (I would recommend making the black beans in the Instant Pot \u2014 if you have one \u2014 and the brown rice on the stovetop so they can cook simultaneously).",
        "Prepare 1 batch of our Gingery Lemon Tahini Sauce (or our 3-ingredient Tahini Sauce or Quick Ginger Miso Tahini Dressing). Set aside.",
        "Steam kale for 1-2 minutes, or until wilted but vibrant green. Set aside.",
        "To serve, divide grains and beans between serving bowls and top with steamed kale, 3 Tbsp each sauerkraut or kimchi, sliced green onion, avocado, sea vegetables (optional), and sesame seeds (optional).",
        "Best when fresh. Store leftovers (sauce separate) in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Kale is best when steamed fresh. Grains and beans are freezer friendly, the rest is best when fresh."
