    "ingredients": [
        "1 15-ounce can chickpeas  ((rinsed, drained, and thoroughly dried))",
        "1 \u00bd Tbsp avocado oil",
        "2 \u00bd - 3 Tbsp tandoori masala spice blend* ((see notes for DIY blend))",
        "1 healthy pinch sea salt",
        "1/2 batch Candied Pecans  ((or other nuts of choice))",
        "6 cups chopped kale",
        "1 Tbsp lime juice",
        "1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil",
        "1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved",
        "5-Minute Smoky Chipotle Dressing"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Add drained and dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with oil and seasonings. Then add to a baking sheet.",
        "Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chickpeas are slightly crispy and slightly browned. Remove from oven and set aside.",
        "Optional: While the chickpeas are baking, prepare candied pecans. If using our recipe, omit the walnuts and just use pecans. We made a half batch, so 1 cup of pecans total (adjust amounts if adjusting serving size).",
        "In the meantime, prepare 5-Minute Smoky Chipotle Dressing.",
        "To assemble salad, add kale to a serving bowl or platter and massage with a little lime juice and oil for 1 minute to tenderize. Then top with roasted chickpeas, grape tomatoes, and candied pecans (optional) and drizzle with the dressing. Toss to coat.",
        "Best when fresh. Store leftovers (pecans and dressing each stored separately) in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Not freezer friendly."
